## Abstract

The impacts of Generative AI in regions of Africa, Asia, and Latin America -with their diverse historical and sociopolitical contexts- are often overshadowed by the hyped and universalising promises of the technology. Global South regions are strategic sites within the global AI value chain grappling with issues of resource exploitation, digital labor outsourcing, and environmental impact. In seeking to overcome the dynamics of extraction, diverse counter-hegemonic responses are contributing to question, adapt and reimagine Gen AI technologies to service the public interest, fundamental rights, and cultural preservation. We draw lessons from how activists, practitioners and thinkers on the margins of AI development, actively assert their autonomy, inspiring a more equitable and culturally responsive digital landscape.

## Repository Contents

### üìä Dataset: `ai_value_chain.txt`
Comprehensive dataset mapping 49 critical sites across the global AI value chain, including:
- **Mineral extraction sites** (cobalt, lithium, rare earth elements, nickel, copper, tin, bauxite)
- **Digital labor hubs** (data annotation, content moderation, platform work, BPO services)
- **AI research centers** (Silicon Valley, Beijing, London, Boston, Tel Aviv, Toronto)
- **Data center infrastructure** (hyperscale, regional, and tropical facilities)
- **Environmental impact zones** (deforestation, water depletion, habitat destruction)

**Data Fields:**
- Geographic coordinates and regional classification
- Production volumes and workforce data
- Environmental impact scores (1-10 scale)
- Human rights violations documentation
- Key corporate actors and authoritative sources

### üó∫Ô∏è Visualization: `hiddengeographies.ipynb`
Notebook that visualizes:
- **Global flow networks** showing resource extraction ‚Üí technology development patterns
- **AI Value Chain locations** showing important points in Global AI Value Chain

## Research Methodology

This research employs **critical cartography** and **value chain analysis** to reveal the hidden geographies that make AI possible. Our approach:

1. **Multi-source data integration** from academic institutions (Stanford HAI, Harvard IRR), investigative journalism (Global Witness, Human Rights Watch), and industry reports (IEA)
2. **Systematic documentation** of environmental and social impacts across the AI supply chain
3. **Geospatial visualization** revealing patterns of extraction and value concentration
4. **Global South perspective** centering voices and experiences from the margins of AI development

## Data Sources & Methodology

**Primary Sources:**
- Academic research institutions (Stanford HAI, Harvard IRR)
- Investigative journalism organizations (Global Witness, Human Rights Watch, Rest of World)
- International organizations (IEA, EU Commission, Amnesty International)
- Industry reports and company disclosures

**Data Quality:**
- Geographic coordinates verified from multiple sources
- Production volumes based on most recent available data (2022-2024)
- Environmental and human rights assessments from authoritative monitoring organizations
- Cross-referenced across minimum three independent sources per site

We welcome:
- Additional data points from underrepresented regions
- Corrections or updates to existing data
- Alternative visualization approaches
- Critical feedback on methodology
